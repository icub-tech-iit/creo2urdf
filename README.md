# creo2urdf
Generate URDF model from CREO Parametric mechanisms.

**Since it is under development, we cannot guarantee that the user interface of `creo2urdf` will not implement breaking changes. Be aware of this if you start using the code contained in this repository**

## CREO Parametric versions supported and tested
- `9.0.8.0`

## Assumptions & limitations

- To export the urdf of the robot, the CREO mechanism has to follow [these guidelines](https://github.com/icub-tech-iit/cad-libraries/wiki/Prepare-PTC-Creo-Mechanism-for-URDF).
- The joints are assumed to be in position 0.
- Right now it can handle only **REVOLUTE**, **PRISMATIC** and **FIXED** joints.

## Installation from binaries

> [!warning]
> Users are encountering issues using the dll, see https://github.com/icub-tech-iit/creo2urdf/issues/84

> [!NOTE]  
> The provided dll has not been unlocked, therefore the Toolkit licence is required for using it
> 

Download `creo2urdf.zip` from the assets of the [latest release](https://github.com/icub-tech-iit/creo2urdf/releases/latest), and extract it in the folder you like.<br>
This archive contains the dll of the plugin and the `text` folder for running it. <br>
Follow the [`Usage`](https://github.com/icub-tech-iit/creo2urdf/tree/master#usage) section instructions for completing the installation. <br>

## Installation from sources

### Dependencies

Right now the `creo2urdf` plugin needs its dependencies to be compiled and linked **statically**:

- Download [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg): `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg`
- Bootstrap vcpkg: `.\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat`

### Build `creo2urdf`

- Export `CREO9_INSTALL_PATH` pointing to the Creo9 installation folder, e.g. `C:\Program Files\PTC\Creo 9.0.8.0\Common Files`
- Pass `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[path to vcpkg]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake` to the creo2urdf compilation.
- Run the CMake `configure` step, then build the project:
    - Within Visual Studio, you can do: **Project > Configure creo2urdf**, then **Build > Build all** 

For those who use the CMake integration in Visual Studio, the `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` option should not be passed to `CMake command arguments`. Instead, the `vcpkg.cmake` file path must be passed in `CMake toolchain file`.

## Usage

- Put in your CREO working directory the `protk.dat` that is automatically generated by CMake in `${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}` (e.g. `C:\Users\ngenesio\icub-tech-iit\creo2urdf\build\x64-Release`).
Or create it by hand as follow:

```
name creo2urdf
Startup dll
Allow_stop True
Delay_start False
exec_file \path\to\creo2urdf.dll
text_dir \path\to\creo2urdf\src\creo2urdf\text
END
```
- Open CREO Parametric: on the first time, you will need to accept the plugin registration
- Load the assembly mechanism of which you want to export the urdf
- Press the button
 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8ad3e71-baa4-40c4-9dbc-084962d425d3" width=800 align=center >

- Select a yaml and csv configuration files with a format explained in the following sections, and the folder where both the urdf the meshes will be saved.


### Test your installation
The folder `examples` contains a simple assembly with two links, called 2BARS.asm. 
You can open the assembly in Creo and then test the installation by clicking on the Creo2Urdf button.
The plugin will ask you to select the related .yaml and .csv files, which are provided in the folder.

If the export process was successful, you should see three files": "bar.stl", "barlonger.stl" and "model.urdf".

### YAML Parameter File
The YAML format is used to pass parameters to the plugin to customized the conversion process.
The parameters accepted by the plugin are documented in the following.

##### Include Parameters
The YAML can eventually include other YAML files using the `includes` parameter, if so, the included files are merged with the main file.
All internal groups are merged if they are maps, they are overwritten only if an element is not a map, taking precedence over the main file in case of conflicts.

> [!NOTE]
> The `includes` parameter is not mandatory, but if it is present, it must be a list of strings, containing relative path respect the directory of the main YAML file.

| Attribute name   | Type   | Default Value | Description  |
|:----------------:|:---------:|:------------:|:-------------:|
| `linkFrames`       | Array | empty | Structure mapping the link names to the displayName of their desired frame. Unfortunatly in URDF the link frame origin placement is not free, but it is constrained to be placed on the parent joint axis, hence this option is for now reserved to the root link and to links connected to their parent by a fixed joint |
| `exportAllUseradded` |  Boolean | False | If true, export all frames starting w/ `SCSYS` in the output URDF as fake links i.e. fake link with zero mass connected to a link with a fixed joint.  |

##### Sensors Parameters
Sensor information can be expressed using arrays of sensor options.
Note that given that the URDF still does not support an official format for expressing sensor information,
this script will output two different elements for each sensor:
* a `<gazebo>` element, necessary to simulate the sensor in Gazebo when loading the URDF, as documented in http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_gzplugins .
* a more URDF-like `<sensor>` element, in particular the variant supported by the iDynTree library, as documented in https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/blob/master/doc/model_loading.md .


| Attribute name   | Type   | Default Value | Description  |
|:----------------:|:---------:|:------------:|:-------------:|
| `forceTorqueSensors` | Array  |  empty      | Array of option for exporting 6-Axis ForceTorque sensors |
| `sensors`            | Array  |  empty      | Array of option for exporting generic sensors (e.g. camera, depth, imu, ray..) |

###### ForceTorque Sensors Parameters (keys of elements of `forceTorqueSensors`)
| Attribute name   | Type   | Default Value | Description  |
|:----------------:|:---------:|:------------:|:-------------:|
| `jointName` | String  |  empty      | Name of the Joint for which this sensor measure the ForceTorque. |
| `directionChildToParent` | Bool | True | True if the sensor measures the force excerted by the child on the parent, false otherwise |
| `sensorName`      | String   | jointName | Name of the sensor, to be used in the output URDF file |
| `exportFrameInURDF` | Bool   | False        | If true, export a fake URDF link whose frame is coincident with the sensor frame (as if the sensor frame was added to the `exportedFrames` array). |
| `exportedFrameName` | String | `sensorName` if defined `jointName` otherwise | Name of the URDF link exported by the `exportFrameInURDF` option |
| `frameName`       | String |  empty  | Name of the frame in which the sensor measure is expressed. Mandatory if `exportFrameInURDF` is set to yes. |
| `linkName`         | String  |  empty      | Name of the parent link at which the sensor is rigidly attached. Mandatory if `exportFrameInURDF` is set to yes. |
| `frameReferenceLink`    | String  | `linkName`    | link at which the sensor frame is attached (to make sense, this link should be rigidly attached to the `linkName`. By default `referenceLink` is assumed to be `linkName`.
| `frame` | String | empty | The value of this element may be one of: child, parent, or sensor. It is the frame in which the forces and torques should be expressed. The values parent and child refer to the parent or child links of the joint. The value sensor means the measurement is rotated by the rotation component of the `<pose>` of this sensor. The translation component of the pose has no effect on the measurement. |
| `sensorBlobs` | String | empty | Array of strings (possibly on multiple lines) represeting complex XML blobs that will be included as child of the `<sensor>` element of type "force_torque" |

Note that for now the FT sensors sensor frame is required to be coincident with child link frame, due
to URDF limitations.

###### Generic Sensors Parameters (keys of elements of `sensors`)
| Attribute name   | Type   | Default Value | Description  |
|:----------------:|:---------:|:------------:|:-------------:|
| `linkName`         | String  |  Mandatory      | Name of the Link at which the sensor is rigidly attached. |
| `frameName`        | String  |  empty      | `displayName` of the frame in which the sensor measure is expressed. The selected frame must be attached to the `referenceLink` link. If empty the frame used for the sensor is coincident with the link frame. |
| `frameReferenceLink`    | String  | linkName    | link at which the sensor frame is attached (to make sense, this link should be rigidly attached to the `linkName`. By default `referenceLink` is assumed to be `linkName`.
| `sensorName`      | String   | LinkName_FrameName | Name of the sensor, to be used in the output URDF file |
| `exportFrameInURDF` | Bool   | False        | If true, export a fake URDF link whose frame is coincident with the sensor frame (as if the sensor frame was added to the `exportedFrames` array) |

| `sensorBlobs` | String | empty | Array of strings (possibly on multiple lines) represeting complex XML blobs that will be included as child of the `<sensor>` element |

##### XML Blobs options
If you use extensions of URDF, we frequently want to add non-standard tags as child of the `<robot>` root element.
Using the XMLBlobs option, you can pass an array of strings (event on multiple lines) represeting complex XML blobs that you
want to include in the converted URDF file. This will be included without modifications in the converted URDF file.
Note that every blob must have only one root element.

| Attribute name   | Type   | Default Value | Description  |
|:----------------:|:---------:|:------------:|:-------------:|
| `XMLBlobs `         | Array of String  |  [] (empty array)   | List of XML Blobs to include in the URDF file as children of `<robot>` |

#### CSV  Parameter File
By using the a .csv file it is possible to load some joint-related information from a csv file. 
The rationale for using CSV over YAML for some information related to the model (for example joint limits) is to use a format that it is easier to modify  using common spreadsheet tools like Excel/LibreOffice Calc, that can be easily used also by people without a background in computer science.

##### Format
The CSV file is loaded and parsed using the [d99kris/rapidcsv](https://github.com/d99kris/rapidcsv) library. Please refer to its documentation for supported dialects of the format.

The CSV file is formed by a header line followed by several content lines,
as in this example:
~~~
joint_name,lower_limit,upper_limit
torso_yaw,-20.0,20.0
torso_roll,-20.0,20.0
~~~

The order of the elements in header line is arbitrary, but the supported attributes
are listed in the following:

| Attribute name | Required | Unit of Measure |   Description  |
|:--------------:|:--------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|
| joint_name     |  **Yes**  |      -          | Name of the joint to which the content line is referring |
| lower_limit    |  No      | Degrees         | `lower` attribute of the `limit` child element of the URDF `joint`. **Please note that we specify this limit here in Degrees, but in the urdf it is expressed in Radians, the plugin will take care of  internally converting this parameter.** |
| upper_limit    |  No      | Degrees         | `upper` attribute of the `limit` child element of the URDF `joint`. **Please note that we specify this limit here in Degrees, but in the urdf it is expressed in Radians, the plugin will take care of  internally converting this parameter.** |
| velocity_limit | No      | Radians/second    | `velocity` attribute of the `limit` child element of the URDF `joint`. |
| effort_limit | No      |  Newton meters    | `effort` attribute of the `limit` child element of the URDF `joint`.
| damping  | No      |  Newton meter seconds / radians    | `damping` of the `dynamics` child element of the URDF `joint`. |
| friction | No      |  Newton meters    | `friction` of the `dynamics` child element of the URDF `joint`. |
